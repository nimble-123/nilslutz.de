# The Challenge

The client had a heavily modified Z-transaction in their ECC system for managing complex procurement requests. The code was entangled with standard SAP logic (user exits, modifications), blocking the S/4HANA upgrade path.

# The Solution

We redesigned the process from the ground up using the **Restful ABAP Programming Model (RAP)** on S/4HANA Private Cloud.

## Key Decisions

1.  **Strict Clean Core**: Zero modifications. All interactions with standard business objects via released APIs (I_PurchaseRequisitionTP).
2.  **Tier 1 Extensibility**: Used purely Key User Extensibility where possible, falling back to specific BADIs only when necessary.
3.  **Fiori Elements**: Replaced the complex Dynpro screen with a standard List Report / Object Page floorplan to reduce UI code maintenance.

# The Outcome

- Successfully decoupled the custom logic from the standard core.
- Enabled "Keep the Core Clean" strategy for future upgrades.
- Improved user experience with a responsive Fiori UI.
