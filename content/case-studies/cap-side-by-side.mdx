# Context

The client needed a supplier portal accessible from the internet without exposing the ERP directly. Security and scalability were paramount.

# Solution Architecture

We chose a **Side-by-Side Extension** pattern on SAP BTP.

- **Backend**: CAP (Node.js) handling business logic and persistence in SAP HANA Cloud.
- **Frontend**: SAP Fiori Elements (Vue.js wrapper or standard UI5) - _Correction: Standard Fiori Elements via OData v4._
- **Integration**: SCC (Cloud Connector) to S/4HANA for master data replication.

## Patterns Used

- **Managed Association**: To simplify data modeling.
- **CQRS**: Separating read (Fiori list) from heavy write operations.

# Outcome

A secure, highly available portal that scales independently of the ERP backend.
