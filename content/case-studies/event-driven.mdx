# The Requirement

A production order change in S/4HANA needed to trigger updates in three different non-SAP subsystems immediately. The point-to-point interface was brittle and slow.

# The Solution

We implemented an **Event-Driven Architecture**.

1.  **Publisher**: S/4HANA publishes `BusinessPartner.Created` and custom `ProductionOrder.Changed` events to SAP Event Mesh.
2.  **Broker**: SAP Event Mesh distributes messages to queues based on topic subscriptions.
3.  **Consumer**: A CAP service subscribes to the queue, transforms the payload, and forwards it to the subsystems (Push).

# Key Takeaway

Loose coupling allowed us to add a 4th consumer system months later without touching the S/4HANA backend.
