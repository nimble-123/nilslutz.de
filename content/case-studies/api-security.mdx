# Problem

External partners were accessing SAP Gateway OData services directly via Basic Auth. This posed security risks and lacked governance (throttling, monitoring).

# Implementation

We introduced **SAP API Management** on BTP as the central gateway.

## Security Flow

1.  **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials**: Partners exchange client id/secret for a JWT.
2.  **API Policy**: Validates JWT, checks quota, and transforms headers.
3.  **Backend Auth**: Principal propagation or Technical User mapping via Cloud Connector.

# Result

Full visibility into API usage, enforced security policies, and protection of the backend system from traffic spikes.
